# Mask-Detection-Classification-WebApp
In this project, I have trained model which classify the images that either person wears a mask or not. It was a binary classification problem. CNN have been used in this project. Also I have hosted model on GitHub and integrate it in single page web application.<br>
For Model Training I have used Google Colab and I trained model keep in mind 
accuracy of prediction.
I have trained models many times by tunining its different paramentes and by
changing layers and using different number of epochs.
<br>
* Accuracy:<br>
--> On Training Data:<br>
		* loss : 0.0075<br>
		* Accuracy: 0.9978<br>
--> On Testing Data:<br>
		* loss : 0.0929<br>
		* accurracy: 0.9637<br>

But After Web Integration, There are some issues that I have faced and my 
accurracy reduced to 70% I am unable to figure out where is problem either 
problem is in model or during image processing. Althoug Same model in 
Google Colab gives 96% accurate result.<br>
Here, I have also attached some of screen captures that how my web page looks like.
