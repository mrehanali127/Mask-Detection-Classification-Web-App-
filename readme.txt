===============   Project Materials  ================================
* Web Page 
* Images That I tested
* GitHub Link where I hosted Model
https://mrehanali127.github.io/Mask_Detection_Model/model.json
* Video (Description of Project)

===========   Project Progress  ======================================
For Model Training I have used Google Colab and I trained model keep in mind 
accuracy of prediction.
I have trained models many times by tunining its different paramentes and by
changing layers and using different number of epochs.

* Accuracy:
--> On Training Data:
		* loss : 0.0075
		* Accuracy: 0.9978
--> On Testing Data:
		* loss : 0.0929
		* accurracy: 0.9637

But After Web Integration, There are some issues that I have faced and my 
accurracy reduced to 70% I am unable to figure out where is problem either 
problem is in model or during image processing. Althoug Same model in 
Google Colab gives 96% accurate result.
